# 🚀 Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Containerized Application using Jenkins, Docker & Nginx

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and Nginx to automate the build, test, push, and deployment of a containerized multi-service application. The system includes a frontend, backend, and Nginx reverse proxy, all managed using Docker Compose.

Jenkins orchestrates the entire pipeline, while Docker ensures consistent containerized environments. Docker Hub is used as a container registry, and Nginx handles request routing between services. The project demonstrates real-world DevOps practices by automating the software delivery lifecycle and reducing manual deployment efforts.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a containerized architecture using Docker Compose to manage multiple services including frontend, backend, and Nginx. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy to route user requests to the appropriate service.

All services run inside isolated Docker containers to ensure consistency and scalability. The CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, pushing, and deploying the application.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using Jenkins to automate the entire software delivery process.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build Stage**
   - Docker images are built for frontend and backend services.

2. **Test Stage**
   - Basic validation is performed to ensure the application is running correctly.

3. **Push Stage**
   - Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub for version control and storage.

4. **Deploy Stage**
   - Containers are deployed using Docker Compose and made accessible via Nginx.

### Pipeline Flow

Build → Test → Push → Deploy
